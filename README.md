# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Project---Python
Diwali Sales Data Analysis | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Cleaned and preprocessed raw Diwali sales dataset by removing null/irrelevant values to ensure data accuracy.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in customer demographics (gender, age group, marital status, location).

Identified that females (26â€“35 yrs) from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka were the highest contributors to sales.

Built data visualizations (bar plots, count plots) to highlight consumer trends and support business decision-making.
